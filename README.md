Data Analysis by building an executive dashboard with Excel and Tableau 
## Description
The goal of this project is to create an executive interactive dashboard that analyzes the data from 2016 to 2018 and gives insights into the data that help in decision-making which makes the company more profitable 
</br>
This is a data analysis project journey starting with data entry by inserting and creating the tables and inserting the data in them using **SQL Server** then querying the wanted data from the database and calculating the revenue by multiplying the **Total units** with **Price** then connecting the query to **Excel** and **Tableau** to make the dashboards 
</br>
The two dashboards share the same analysis process but **Tableau** gives more space for the dashboard to be dynamic and more active than **Excel**
</br>
*that is because Tableau is meant for visualization and dashboards*
</br>
## Excel Dashboard

</br>
The executive team can easily select which year, state, or store they want to have insights about and click on it\them
</br>
the dashboard answers these questions:
* What are the revenues in each year 
* What are the revenues in each month of the years
* What is the state that makes the highest revenues
* Which store sells the best
* Which category is more sold than the others 
* Who are the top 10 sellers to make revenue for the company 
* Who are the 10 most valued customers according to the revenues
## Tableau Dashboard

</br>
As the Excel dashboard, it answers the same questions but with more visually attractive, clearer visualization, more dynamical, and gives more details about the company status 
</br>
Like the Excel dashboard, it also answers:
* the number of orders the company made in each year 
* the number of customers the company has gained yearly 
* The total units sold
* and the executive team the top (N) customers\salers *Not fixed as the Excel dashboard*
